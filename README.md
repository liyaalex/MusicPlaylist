# MusicPlaylist



Technology - React-Node Js-Rest API
The project is developed for music playlist creation which allows users to search music through Discogs music API and 
save their favorite songs to the list.It was a team work project and my responsibility was sending data from the API 
to the server . And it also helps users to refer their favorites at any time.
